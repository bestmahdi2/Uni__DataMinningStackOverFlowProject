i will appreciate any help i can get even a small advice and thanks in advance.[i also added a screen capture for the error while compilling the script here][1]

34666148,Openshift v3 - update image stream to fetch changes from external docker registry,"<p>I'm seeming to run into a simple problem and have the feeling I'm missing something essential.</p>

<p>I'm having a private docker image registry at our company, which hosts all the docker images we develop.</p>

<p>This registry is constantly updated during our build process and new images are pushed to it quite often.</p>

<p>Now we are utilizing an openshift system, with a handful of images and it's own registry. </p>

<p>What would be the best way to synchronize images between these 2 systems?</p>

<pre><code>oc new-app myregistry.mydomain.edu/binbase/minix

<p>which is running nicely.</p>
