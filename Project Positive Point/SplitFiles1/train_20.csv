should the function to query the the object from the STORE be in the page file, before the render method, or should I use action creators and include the function in reducers.

34843297,Modify @OneToMany entity in Spring Data Rest without its repository,"<p>In my project I use object of type <em>A</em> which has OneToMany relation (orphanRemoval = true, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER) to objects of type <em>B</em>. I need SpringDataRest (SDR) to store complete full <em>A</em> object with its <em>B</em> objects (children) using single one POST request. I tried several combinations in SDR, the only one which worked for me, was to create @RepositoryRestResource for object <em>A</em> and to create @RepositoryRestResource also for object <em>B</em>, but mark this (<em>B</em>) as exported=false (if I did not create repository out of object <em>B</em> at all, it would not work -> just <em>A</em> object would be stored on single POST request, but not its children (@OneToMany relation) of type <em>B</em>; the same outcome occurs if exported=false is omitted for <em>B</em> repository).
 Is this ok and the only way how to achieve it (single POST request with storing all objects at once)?</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking, in my previous example, I have to (I would like to) control all objects ""lifecycle"" by using <em>A</em>'s repository. I am ok with it, because <em>A</em>-><em>B</em> relation is composition (<em>B</em> does not exists outside of <em>A</em>). But I have serious problem of editing (also removing) one certain object of type <em>B</em> by SDR using its parent repository (since object <em>B</em> doest not have its own repository exported). Maybe, this is not possible by definition. I have tried these solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>PATCH for ""/A/1/B/2"" does not work -> method not allowed (in headers
is ""Allow: GET, DELETE"") -> so, also PUT is out of question</li>
<li>Json Patch would not work either - PATCH for ""/A/1"" using json patch
content-type [{""op"": ""add"", ""path"": ""/B/2"", ....}] -> ""no such index
in target array"" - because Json Patch uses scalar ""2"" after ""array""
as a index to its array. This is not practical in Java world, when
relations are kept in Set of objects - indexing has no meaning
at all.</li>
<li>I could export repository (exported=true) of object <em>B</em> for
manipulating it ""directly"", but this way I would loose ability to
store the whole object <em>A</em> with its <em>B</em> objects at one single POST
request as I have mentioned before.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to avoid sending the whole <em>A</em> object with one single tiny   modification of its <em>B</em> object for PUT, if possible.
Thank you.</p>

 - A method called checkMatch that takes as an argument an int array and returns how many numbers match the class's int array. To match, the same numbers must be in the same position.

Write a main class which asks to user to enter 6 numbers as their lottery ticket and store it in an array. Then create a PowerBall object and give the user's ticket to the checkMatch method. Then figure out the amount won based on the return value.

The winnings are determined as follows:
If 0 numbers match, no winnings
If 1 number matches, win $4
If 2 numbers match, win $7
If 3 numbers match, win $100
If 4 numbers match, win $10,000
If 5 numbers match, win $1 Million
If all 6 numbers match, win Grand Prize of $450 Million
