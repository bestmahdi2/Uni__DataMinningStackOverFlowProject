34615898,React Server side rendering of CSS modules,"<p>The current practice for CSS with React components seems to be using webpack's style-loader to load it into the page in.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>import React, { Component } from 'react';
import style from './style.css';

class MyComponent extends Component {
    render(){
        return (
            &lt;div className={style.demo}&gt;Hello world!&lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>By doing this the style-loader will inject a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element into the DOM. However, the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> will not be in the virtual DOM and so if doing server side rendering, the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> will be omitted. This cause the page to have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content"" rel=""noreferrer"">FOUC</a>.</p>

<p>Is there any other methods to load <a href=""https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules"" rel=""noreferrer"">CSS modules</a> that work on both server and client side?</p>

34616725,C: non-NULL terminated unsigned char *,"I saw [here][1] that it isn't possible to find out an unsigned char * length using strlen if it isn't NULL terminated, since the strlen function will go over the string but won't find any '\0', hence a run-time error. I figure that it is exactly the same for signed char *.

I saw a code snippet that was doing something like `int len = sizeof(unsigned char *);` but, as I understand, it only gives the size of a pointer - word size. Is it possible to use sizeof in another way to get the result or do I have to get the length somewhere else?

<p>...where <code>position</code> is an instance of my <code>GKGameModel</code> subclass <code>Position</code>.

34621006,How can a file contain null bytes?,"<p>How is it possible that files can contain null bytes in operating systems written in a language with null-terminating strings (namely, C)?</p>

<p>For example, if I run this shell code:</p>

<pre><code>$ printf ""Hello\00, World!"" &gt; test.txt
$ xxd test.txt
0000000: 4865 6c6c 6f00 2c20 576f 726c 6421       Hello., World!
</code></pre>

<p>I see a null byte in <code>test.txt</code> (at least in OS X). If C uses null-terminating strings, and OS X is written in C, then how come the file isn't terminated at the null byte, resulting in the file containing <code>Hello</code> instead of <code>Hello\00, World!</code>? Is there a fundamental difference between files and strings?</p>

34621905,need help to solve stock market puzzle in java for max profit,"need max profit. 

what i can modify to get the max profit if i can only buy once and sell once. 
means if i buy at 5 and sell at 150 then its max profit. 

Currently what is have done is buy when price is less than next day ,and sell if price is more than next day. 

as obvious We have to keep in mind we can sell only after we buy, means sell index can not be before buy index.
 
what i have done so far is : 

    package com;
    
    public class Stock {

34622482,How does ap fromMaybe compose?,"<p>There I was, writing a function that takes a value as input, calls a function on that input, and if the result of that is <code>Just x</code>, it should return <code>x</code>; otherwise, it should return the original input.</p>

<p>In other words, this function (that I didn't know what to call):</p>

<pre><code>foo :: (a -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
foo f x = fromMaybe x (f x)
</code></pre>

<p>Since it seems like a general-purpose function, I wondered if it wasn't already defined, so <a href=""https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/684418608454352896"">I asked on Twitter</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bitemyapp/status/684467784793886720"">Chris Allen replied</a> that it's <code>ap fromMaybe</code>.</p>

<p>That sounded promising, so I fired up GHCI and started experimenting:</p>

<pre><code>Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap
ap :: Monad m =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type fromMaybe
fromMaybe :: a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap fromMaybe
ap fromMaybe :: (b -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; b -&gt; b
</code></pre>

<p>The type of <code>ap fromMaybe</code> certainly looks correct, and a couple of experiments seem to indicate that it has the desired behaviour as well.</p>

<p>But <strong>how does it work?</strong></p>

<p>The <code>fromMaybe</code> function seems clear to me, and in isolation, I think I understand what <code>ap</code> does - at least in the context of <code>Maybe</code>. When <code>m</code> is <code>Maybe</code>, it has the type <code>Maybe (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code>.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is how <code>ap fromMaybe</code> even compiles. To me, this expression looks like partial application, but I may be getting that wrong. If this is the case, however, I don't understand how the types match up.</p>

<p>The first argument to <code>ap</code> is <code>m (a -&gt; b)</code>, but <code>fromMaybe</code> has the type <code>a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a</code>. How does that match? Which <code>Monad</code> instance does the compiler infer that <code>m</code> is? How does <code>fromMaybe</code>, which takes two (curried) arguments, turn into a function that takes a single argument?</p>

<p>Can someone help me connect the dots?</p>

<p>I know there isn't a totally fundamental issue with my Java code because it works as expected when I use ws://echo.websocket.org as the URI instead of wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com. However when I try to connect to wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Websocket closed: draft org.java_websocket.drafts.Draft_17@7ca2fefb refuses handshake
</code></pre>

<p>There is no authentication or anything like for this connection as far as I know (I didn't provide any in my Python program) so I'm at a loss as to what the source of this error is.</p>
