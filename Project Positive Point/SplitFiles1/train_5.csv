34601582,what is the difference between import and const and which is preferred in commonjs,"<p>I have noticed a bit of switching between using const and import for referencing libraries in node.js applications using es6 syntax with Babel.</p>

<p>What is the preferred method and what is the difference between using const and import? Assuming you may be importing the same library in many files/components.</p>

<p><strong>const</strong></p>

<pre><code>const React = require('react')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>import</strong></p>

<pre><code>import React from 'react'
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the definitions of each but I am still not sure which to use.</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import"">import</a></p>

<p>The import statement is used to import functions, objects or primitives that have been exported from an external module, another script, etc.</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const"">const</a></p>

<p>The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.</p>

34603388,Should Comparable ever compare to another type?,"<p>I'm wondering if there's ever a valid use case for the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {}

class A implements Comparable&lt;Base&gt; {
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to be a common pattern (see <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Collections</a> for a number of examples) to accept a collection of type <code>T</code>, where <code>T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>But it seems technically impossible to fulfill the contract of <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo-T-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>compareTo()</code></a> when comparing to a base class, because there's no way to ensure that another class doesn't extend the base with a contradictory comparison. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {
    final int foo;
    Base(int foo) {
        this.foo = foo;
    }
}

class A extends Base implements Comparable&lt;Base&gt; {
    A(int foo) {
        super(foo);
    }
    public int compareTo(Base that) {
        return Integer.compare(this.foo, that.foo); // sort by foo ascending
    }
}

class B extends Base implements Comparable&lt;Base&gt; {
    B(int foo) {
        super(foo);
    }
    public int compareTo(Base that) {
        return -Integer.compare(this.foo, that.foo); // sort by foo descending
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have two classes extending <code>Base</code> using comparisons that don't follow a common rule (if there were a common rule, it would almost certainly be implemented in <code>Base</code>). Yet the following broken sort will compile:</p>

<pre><code>Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(new A(0), new B(1)));
</code></pre>

<p>Wouldn't it be safer to only accept <code>T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>? Or is there some use case that would validate the wildcard?</p>

(500/500,000)*50,000 = 5

So 5 in 50,000 people Know him right.

But When  friends count increase the 50,000 should decrease

like:-

If ""sam"" has 1000 friends then

(1000/500,000)*25000 = 5

So 5 in 25000 people know his name

Yes we could implement this in if/else condition 
If so then i have to write 500 lines of code.

Is there is a another way to do this in PHP.

Help !

I have a few questions:

(1) Can Min-Max notation be used in case of any relationships, or, just when there is an indication for that in the description?

(2) Are my many-to-many relationships portrayed correctly here?

(3) Could I properly portray the relationships among Account vs Account Statement vs StatementID? 

(4) As per my assumption, Is Account Statement really a weak entity and is `Has` really a weak relation that is dependent on Statement ID? Is issue-date a weak key?
