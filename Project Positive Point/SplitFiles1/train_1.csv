</code></pre>

<p>compile but</p>

<pre><code>return x == 0 ? """" : ""Hello""

<p>does?</p>

<p>This is really weird because all the other operators don't need an extra white space. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>let x = 1+1
let y = 1 + 1
</code></pre>

<p>are the same.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with optionals. But when you use a <code>?</code> operator on a variable, it must be used like this:</p>

<pre><code>let s: String? = nil
let x = s?.startIndex
</code></pre>

<p>I mean it must follow another operator, right?</p>

34558390,Why does the reverse() function in the Swift standard library return ReverseRandomAccessCollection?,"<p>Now that I've learned Swift (to a reasonable level) I'm trying to get to grips with the standard library, but in truth it's mainly ελληνικά to me!</p>

<p>So a specific question: I have an array of strings and I can call reverse() on it.</p>

<pre><code>let arr = [""Mykonos"", ""Rhodes"", ""Naxos""].reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>Now naively I thought I'd get back a type of Array from this. (Ruby for example has a similar method that you pass an array and get back an array)</p>

<p>But arr is now actually of type</p>

<pre><code>ReverseRandomAccessCollection&lt;Array&lt;String&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which is actually a struct, which conforms to CollectionType:</p>

<pre><code>public struct ReverseRandomAccessCollection&lt;Base : CollectionType where Base.Index : RandomAccessIndexType&gt; : _ReverseCollectionType
</code></pre>

<p>This means I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>for item in arr {
  print(item)
}
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't do</p>

<pre><code>print(arr[0])
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this designed to be this way?</p>

<p>Dictionaries in Swift also implement CollectionType, so I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>let dict = [""greek"" : ""swift sometimes"", ""notgreek"" : ""ruby for this example""].reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>But dictionaries are not ordered like arrays, so why can I call reverse() on dicts?</p>

<p>Bonus points if anyone can point me in the direction of where I can read up and improve my Swift stdlib foo, Ευχαριστώ!</p>

34559058,How to create a function that returns a byte array in C++? Arduino project.,"I am currently starting to learn C++ via Arduino programming. I am programming an 8*8 LED Matrix, and currently have a semi-working code that uses a joystick to control a dot on screen. Only problem is: its nearly 1000 lines long. It's equivalent to writing an 1000 page essay only saying ""Pig, blanket, market"" over and over again until I get to the actual logic involved.

My friend suggested to make it shorter, I could make a function which returns a byte. 

How does one do this?

34564253,How to make Xcode automatically conform to a protocol,"<p>When I use a prototype table view, I always have to conform to the protocol <code>TableViewDataSource</code>. I always forget what methods I need to implement, so I have to look at the source of the protocol every time. This is really time consuming.</p>

<p>I think Xcode must have a feature that automatically implements the needed methods for you, right? Just like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I want to know where can I find this feature. If there's isn't, is there a workaround for this? At least I don't have to open the source code of the protocol each time I conform to it.</p>

<p>If you don't understand what I mean, here's some code:</p>

<p>I have a protocol</p>

<pre><code>protocol Hello {
    func doStuff ()
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I conform to it,</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass: Hello {

}
</code></pre>

<p>I often don't remember the names of the methods that I need to implement. If Xcode has a feature that turns the above code, into this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass: Hello {
    func doStuff () {
        code
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you understand what I mean? I just want to ask where to find such a feature.</p>

34564466,java mongodb driver how do you catch exceptions?,"<p>I want to be able to detect if a mongo server is available from the java driver for the purpose of reacting to any abnormal events as one would in JDBC land etc. It all works fine when the server is up but I am struggling to understand why it is so difficult to detect errors. I have a feeling its because the mongo client runs in a different thread and it doesn't re throw to me or something?</p>

<pre><code>try {
        MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(""localhost"", 27017);
        MongoDatabase db = mongoClient.getDatabase(""mydb"");
        // if db is down or error getting people collection handle it in catch block
        MongoCollection&lt;Document&gt; people = commentarr.getCollection(""people"");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // handle server down or failed query here.
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The result is </p>

<pre><code>INFO: Exception in monitor thread while connecting to server localhost:27017
</code></pre>

<p>With the resulting stack trace containing a few different exceptions which I have tried to catch but my catch blocks still didn't do anything.</p>

<pre><code>com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening socket
Caused by: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>I am using the java mongodb driver 3.0.4, most posts I read are from an older API with hacks like <code>MongoClient.getDatabaseNames()</code> which throws a <code>MongoException</code> if errors, except this is deprecated now and replaced with <code>MongoClient.listDatabaseNames()</code> which doesn't have the same error throwing semantics.</p>

<p>Is there a way to just execute a mongo query from the java driver in a try catch block and actually have the exception caught?</p>
