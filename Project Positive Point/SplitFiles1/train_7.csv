34629249,Inject namespace experimental to std,"<p>Is it bad or good parctice to inject namespace <code>std::experimental</code> into <code>std</code> like following?</p>

#include &lt;experimental/optional&gt;

{
    std::optional&lt; int &gt; o;

#else
#error !

<p>The intention to introduce <code>std::experimental</code> ""sub-namespace"" is clear because <code>std::experimental</code> currently contains <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental"">a plenty of <strong>new</strong> libraries</a>. I think it is very likely all them will migrate into <code>namespace std</code> without any substantial changes and user code written currently can rely upon this (am I totally wrong?). Otherwise all this code should be refactored to change from <code>std::experimental::</code> to <code>std::</code> in the future. It is not big deal, but there may be reasons not to do so.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are basically two sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>a side-block (preferably) on the right that serves as image-thumbnails scroller;</li>
<li>a contents-block on the left (in my draw) in which there are text parts and an image that is selected from the right side-scroller.</li>
</ul>

<p>Side scrolling may be achieved by a browser sidebar or (<em>very much</em> preferably better) by apposite up/down buttons.
 When clicking on a different image on the side-scroller that image get shown in place of the previous one.
Last thing, clicking the image selected shall make it show in full-size (not larger than browser window anyway) with a lightbox-like-effect.</p>

<p>As per the lots and lots of references online I have already done the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the Application Pool to <code>StartMode=AlwaysRunning</code></li>
<li>Set the site in question (that belongs to beforementioned Pool) to <code>preloadEnabled=true</code></li>
<li>Install the <code>Application Initialization</code> feature to the Windows installation</li>
<li>Add the <code>&lt;applicationInitialization&gt;</code> node to the web.config's <code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;</code> node</li>
</ul>

<p>The web application is based on Owin and has a simple log4net logging statement in it's <code>Startup.Configuration()</code> method. Now when restarting IIS I see that the w3svc.exe process is running, so I know the <code>StartMode=AlwaysRunning</code> is working. There are however no logging messages in the log file.</p>

<p>Navigating to any url (even a nonexisting one) in the application will start the app and add the log line.</p>

<p>Because of the actual work that's done in the startup of the application I really want the application to truly preload, but I seem to be unable to get it done.</p>

<p>Searching this site I have unfortunately not been able to find a solution. </p>

<p>Please remove or revise any misleading content in your app and its metadata.</p>

<p>Since your iTunes Connect Application State is Rejected, a new binary will be required. Make the desired metadata changes when you upload the new binary.</p>

Yes, my bad, I just didn't know it was required.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is,
would replying to Apple through the resolution center and including a document from Keshet's legel dept. be enough to resolve this issue?
or do I need to go through the whole process again, submitting a new binary etc.?
or perhaps something else?</p>

<p>Also, does this kind of rejection means that every other aspect of the game I submitted is okay?
because they only reacted to the rights to use Keshet's properties.</p>
