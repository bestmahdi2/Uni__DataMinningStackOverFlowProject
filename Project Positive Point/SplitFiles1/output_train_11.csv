    handleSubmit: PropTypes.func.isRequired,

<p>I added the <a href=""https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk"" rel=""noreferrer"">redux-thunk</a> middleware to the store and setup the action creator(s) for logging in as described in the <a href=""http://rackt.org/redux/docs/advanced/AsyncActions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">redux docs for Async Actions</a>:</p>

<p><strong>authActions.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>import ApiClient from '../apiClient'

const apiClient = new ApiClient()

<p>Again, in redux DevTools I can see that this works as expected. When <code>dispatch(login(formData))</code> is called in <code>onSubmit</code> in the LoginForm, first the <code>LOGIN_REQUEST</code> action is dispatched, followed by <code>LOGIN_SUCCESS</code> or <code>LOGIN_FAILURE</code>. <code>LOGIN_REQUEST</code> will add a property <code>state.auth.pending = true</code> to the store, <code>LOGIN_SUCCESS</code> and <code>LOGIN_FAILURE</code> will remove this property. (I know this might me something to use <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/reselect"" rel=""noreferrer"">reselect</a> for, but for now I want to keep it simple.</p>

<p>Now, in the redux-form docs I read that I can return a promise from <code>onSubmit</code> to update the form state (<code>submitting</code>, <code>error</code>). But I'm not sure what's the correct way to do this. <code>dispatch(login(formData))</code> returns <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>I could exchange the <code>state.auth.pending</code> flag in the store with a variable like <code>state.auth.status</code> with the values <em>requested</em>, <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em> (and again, I could probably use reselect or something alike for this).</p>

<p>I could then subscribe to the store in <code>onSubmit</code> and handle changes to <code>state.auth.status</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>// ...

class LoginForm extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        super(props)
        this.onSubmit = this.onSubmit.bind(this)
    }
    onSubmit (formData, dispatch) {
        const { store } = this.context
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
            const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =&gt; {
                const state = store.getState()
                const status = state.auth.status

                if (status === 'success' || status === 'failure') {
                    unsubscribe()
                    status === 'success' ? resolve() : reject(state.auth.error)

    }

    // ...

<p>However, this solution doesn't feel good and I'm not sure if it will always work as expected when the app grows and more actions might be dispatched from other sources.</p>

34686287,Automating CSV file merging and cleaning preferably by using Batch or Powershell,"I'm not a code guy and have spent whole day trying to get this done without success, hoping I can get some help from the experts. 

I have a folder called Vehicles, within which are two sub-folders - Automobiles and Trucks. Each of sub-folders contain two CSV files which have identical (to that sub-folder) headers/structure.
What I'm trying to accomplish:

1. Take the two CSV files in Automobiles folder merge them without duplicating headers and name the merged file as Automobiles.csv
2. Delete all rows in Automobiles.csv where 6th column (header is Fuel_Type) is ""Diesel"" (without the quotes) then move the file from sub-folder to main Vehicles folder.
3. Take the two CSV files in Trucks folder merge them without duplicating headers and name merge file as Trucks.csv
3. For merged file in trucks folder remove all rows where 6th column (header is ""Fuel_Type"") is ""Diesel"" (without the quotes) then move the file from sub-folder to main Vehicles folder.
Obviously if someone can help with 1 and 2 I can manipulate it for 3 and 4.
5. BONUS POINTS :) take the Automobiles.csv and Trucks.csv files and create Vehicles.xls file with Automobiles and Trucks tabs.

Few details - files are pretty large, each CSV can up to 350 thousand rows x 150 columns and be 200 MB in size each. All the Batch scripts that I tried to put together removing headers seemed to freeze with larger files.

Due to user permissions  on work computers would strongly prefer to use something that is native to Windows7/8 and doesn't require additional software, but would consider other options if nothing native is available.

Thanks in advance!

2. Delete all rows in Automobiles.csv where 6th column (header is Fuel_Type) is ""Diesel"" (without the quotes) then move the file from sub-folder to main Vehicles folder.
3. Take the two CSV files in Trucks folder merge them without duplicating headers and name merge file as Trucks.csv
3. For merged file in trucks folder remove all rows where 6th column (header is ""Fuel_Type"") is ""Diesel"" (without the quotes) then move the file from sub-folder to main Vehicles folder.
Obviously if someone can help with 1 and 2 I can manipulate it for 3 and 4.
5. BONUS POINTS :) take the Automobiles.csv and Trucks.csv files and create Vehicles.xls file with Automobiles and Trucks tabs.

Few details - files are pretty large, each CSV can up to 350 thousand rows x 150 columns and be 200 MB in size each. All the Batch scripts that I tried to put together removing headers seemed to freeze with larger files.

Due to user permissions  on work computers would strongly prefer to use something that is native to Windows7/8 and doesn't require additional software, but would consider other options if nothing native is available.

Thanks in advance!

34698074,Securing a PHP Server from a Hijacker,"<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> I'm implementing a PHP Server without HTTPS/SSL.  On it, I want to authenticate that the user making calls to server is valid assuming that the communication between the app and the server is being watched by a hijacker (hacker with a network sniffer).  I further assume that the hijacker is an app owner trying to figure out how the app communicates with the server in order to hack my system.  I will have no control on who is an app owner.</p>

<p>What I have implemented so far is that the app needs to start a session before they can any work against the server.  To do this the app first sends a request to the server with a randomly generated code, and an authorization number, and the server responds with a security token.  The authorization number is based on the code and some other secret information in the app.  On subsequent calls the app regenerates the code and uses the token plus other secret information recalculate an authorization number (it never retransmits the token to the server either).  This is how each call is validated.</p>

<p>It's set up so that the calling parameters of one call cannot be reused the next time, so that if a hijacker can see the message used within a session, they cannot do anything with it.  Using them simply indicates that the call is ""not authorized"".  I'm 99% sure I've plugged all the related holes to the session communication, such that the hijacker cannot invade my environment.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> The hijacker will see the original session request, reuse those parameters to get a new session and use them to eventually figure out how the session calls the work.  </p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What strategy would you employ to validate that it is only my app talking to the server during the initial session request and not a hijacker impersonating my app in order to start a session?  </p>

<p>Note: Saving the session start parameters is unrealistic.  One idea I have is to embed the ""GMT time + N seconds"" into the randomly generated code then test to see if the server's GMT &lt; app's GMT+N; this way the randomly generated code become invalid within N seconds.</p>

34701855,"ArrayList project at college, some questions","So hey guys I have some things to ask,

I have to program my first, call it project, in my first semester. It's about programming an appointment calendar (don't really know how it's called in english, like a scheduleish thing :P). Until now we've learned the major stuff (for, if, etc.), how to connect classes, create a constructor and about objects. So we have to program this schedule pretty easily with ArrayList and it should delete, edit, create, list the entries. You have to just type in a date and an entry,
f. e.: 10.01.16   ""example"".

It doesn't even have to sort it after the date, but I'm really struggling at some points. 

 1. I listened to some dudes in my class and one said, he would have
    wrote 9 classes. I couldn't even think of that, why so many?
 2. Also how do I save the entries? Just with examplelist.add and it
    just saves like that?
 3. Why do I need a getter and setter, if I could just wrote that stuff
    in my constructor?
 4. How do I make it look nice, just a println/printf(""\n"") in a loop
    after each entry?

First of all, thanks for reading this and spending time for helping a lowbie, I appreciate everything you have to offer. I will go to bed now, spending my whole day tomorrow to write that. Most likely I will have some more questions.
