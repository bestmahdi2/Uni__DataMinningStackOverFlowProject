34607210,How do you add a Root element/Tag in XML using perl,"I have a XML data which does not have a root element/tag. Is there a way where you can add a Root tag? This is just an example.

***Example : Existing XML***

         <Module name=""ALU"">
         <input name=""power_control_bus""/>
         <bidirection name=""address_bus""/>
         </Module>
         <Module name=""Power_control"">
         <input name=""cpu_control_bus""/>
         <output name=""power_control_bus""/>
         <bidirection name=""address_bus""/>
         </Module>

Now I'd like to add a Root tag/element to this XML using perl

***What I'm looking for***

         <Root>
           <Module name=""AL"">
           <input name=""cpu""/>
           <bidirection name=""add""/>
           </Module>          
           <Module name=""Pow"">
           <input name=""cpu""/>
           <output name=""pow""/>
           <bidirection name=""add""/>
           </Module>
        </Root>

**NOTE:** I'm using XML::Simple module because the perl script is written in such and its tedious to convert to any other XML module as of now. It'll be great if we can get an explanation for the answer!

thanks!",<xml><perl><xml-simple>,16/01/05 8:30,LQ_EDIT
34607877,What document is Play Store expecting me to upload to show that I'm not impersonating others?,"<p>My company is currently making an Android application for a local $BigCarManufacturer dealer. We are not impersonating anyone, the application is under the name of ""$BigCarManufacturer $dealer"", and we even cooperated with some guys from $BigCarManufacturer to provide us some web services from their official website. Unfortunately, the application was immediately suspended for impersonation, and now I can only appeal the removal. When I do, I get the option to upload some documents, and the following message: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you selected Intellectual property and impersonation or deceptive behavior above, please provide a document that proves you have the rights to use specific content, icons, images, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what exactly is expected here? The scans of the contract? In what language? The contract doesn't exist in English, and is pretty trivial otherwise, basically ""make an app for us, we'll pay you X, and use anything you need from our website"". No one was anal enough to specify individual icons, images or anything silly like that since none of those rights were transferred to us in the first place, we are merely using assets to build an app <em>for them</em>.</p>

<p>To be clear, no AnyCPU build exists for my library - only x86, x64 and ARM.</p>

<p>An equivalent and potentially more common situation is one where I have a dependency on an external library that is only provided as architecture-specific builds (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D"" rel=""noreferrer"">Win2D</a>). To keep the context simple, let's assume there are no dependencies and only my own code is involved - the solution should reduce to the same thing either way.</p>

34615796,pure Domain Driven Design in PHP project,"<p>In ""PHP World"" there is a weird feeling about infrastructure layer in any DDD application (example) what I could found.</p>

<p>I see many examples, when developers using <code>Doctrine2</code> in infrastructure layer, use Domain entities (from Domain layer) as <code>Doctrine2</code> models, puting doc comments on top on it, or mention them in config (xml, yml).
For instance, <a href=""https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample"" rel=""nofollow"">Big Blue Book example</a>, this is where domain entities are located: <a href=""https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample/tree/master/CargoBackend/src/Model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample/tree/master/CargoBackend/src/Model</a>, and as you can see it's highly coupled with Doctrine (look on annotations). Are they ?</p>

<p>I've feeling that this is wrong way.</p>

<p>What I understood about DDD, is:
Repository should make a query to persistence layer and pass result to factory to instantiate <code>Aggregate Root</code> entity (Domain model) properly. It means that only Factory knows how specific Aggregate Root might be instantiated, moreover there is a, so called, entities lyfe cycle. It means that not every time Domain entity should be instantiated (hydrated) via <code>__construct</code>.</p>

<p>If I have correct feeling, then where is a good example, of proper usage <code>Doctrine2</code> in DDD-like application?</p>

34617269,How to use Byebug with Sidekiq and Foreman,"<p>I have a rails application in which I use foreman to start my rails and sidekiq servers. Since foreman doesn't interact well with regular byebug (you can't see the prompt as you type), I have set up remote debugging for both my rails and sidekiq servers. This works perfectly for the rails server, but when I connect to the byebug server for the sidekiq server, I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle exec byebug -R localhost:58501
Connecting to byebug server localhost:58501...
Connected.
(byebug:ctrl)
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm unable to catch any byebug breakpoints.</p>

<p>According to the documentation, the (byebug:ctrl) prompt means that the program has terminated normally (<a href=""https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/blob/master/GUIDE.md"">https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/blob/master/GUIDE.md</a>), but sidekiq is running jobs just fine.</p>

<p>Is there something incorrect in my configuration, or is sidekiq just not compatible with byebug's remote debugging? </p>

<p><strong>Procfile:</strong></p>

<pre><code>sidekiq: bundle exec sidekiq
rails: rails server
</code></pre>

<p><strong>config/initializers/byebug.rb:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if Rails.env.development?
  require 'byebug'

  def find_available_port
    server = TCPServer.new(nil, 0)
    server.addr[1]
  ensure
    server.close if server
  end

  port = find_available_port

  puts ""Starting remote debugger...""
  Byebug.start_server 'localhost', port
  puts ""Remote debugger on port #{port}""
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that when I don't use remote debugging, byebug functions fine with sidekiq (although in foreman I can't see the prompt as I type).</p>

<p>Also note that I've tried using <code>Byebug.wait_connection = true</code> before <code>Byebug.start_server</code>, but I have the same issue.</p>
