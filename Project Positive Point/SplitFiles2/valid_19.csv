Whenever I do any apps, I don't use any framework and even tho it's working, my code looks really untidy, it lacks a nice structure. Can you advise any nicely formatted, object oriented, MVC framework which works well with node.js apps and EJS? (besides express.js)</p>

34773317,Python Pandas removing substring using another column,"<p>I've tried searching around and can't figure out an easy way to do this, so I'm hoping your expertise can help.</p>

<p>I have a pandas data frame with two columns</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

pd.options.display.width = 1000
testing = pd.DataFrame({'NAME':[
    'FIRST', np.nan, 'NAME2', 'NAME3', 
    'NAME4', 'NAME5', 'NAME6'], 'FULL_NAME':['FIRST LAST', np.nan, 'FIRST LAST', 'FIRST NAME3', 'FIRST NAME4 LAST', 'ANOTHER NAME', 'LAST NAME']})
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me</p>

<pre><code>          FULL_NAME   NAME
0        FIRST LAST  FIRST
1               NaN    NaN
2        FIRST LAST  NAME2
3       FIRST NAME3  NAME3
4  FIRST NAME4 LAST  NAME4
5      ANOTHER NAME  NAME5
6         LAST NAME  NAME6
</code></pre>

<p>what I'd like to do is take the values from the 'NAME' column and remove then from the 'FULL NAME' column if it's there. So the function would then return</p>

<pre><code>          FULL_NAME   NAME           NEW
0        FIRST LAST  FIRST          LAST
1               NaN    NaN           NaN
2        FIRST LAST  NAME2    FIRST LAST
3       FIRST NAME3  NAME3         FIRST
4  FIRST NAME4 LAST  NAME4    FIRST LAST
5      ANOTHER NAME  NAME5  ANOTHER NAME
6         LAST NAME  NAME6     LAST NAME
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I've defined a function below and am using the apply method. This runs rather slow on my large data set though and I'm hoping there's a more efficient way to do it. Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>def address_remove(x):
    try:
        newADDR1 = re.sub(x['NAME'], '', x[-1])
        newADDR1 = newADDR1.rstrip()
        newADDR1 = newADDR1.lstrip()
        return newADDR1
    except:
        return x[-1]

}).addTo(map);

<p>How would I add the text ""Banff Airfield"" as a label to this icon? Is the easiest and most efficient way through using an image editor? if so, I will do that method, but wondering if there was a better way. Thanks!</p>
