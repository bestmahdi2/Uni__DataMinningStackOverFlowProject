34619582,Generate a Stripe test card token for testing,"<p>I am using Stripe in my app. I want to write an integration test for placing a payment that checks Stripe that a payment was created. I'm using Stripe.js.</p>

<p>In my test I need a card token to perform the test charge. Usually this token would be generated client side with stripe.js and sent in the request to perform the charge. As this is a server-side only test is there some way I can generate a token from within the test?</p>

<p>For reference the test would be something like this (uses php but the principle is the same):</p>

<pre><code>/** @test **/
public function it_creates_a_charge()
{
    $order = factory(Order::class)-&gt;create();
    $stripe_token = Stripe::generateToken([
                                          'card' =&gt; '4242424242424242'
                                          'exp'  =&gt; '04/2017',
                                          'cvc'  =&gt; '123'
                                          ]); // does not exist afaik

    $response = $this-&gt;post('charges/store', [
                'stripe_token' =&gt; $stripe_token,
                'order_id' =&gt; $order-&gt;id,
                //etc
                ]);

    // assertions...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially I'm asking if there's something within the Stripe API that allows server-side token generation.</p>

34622076,Calling an explicit constructor with a braced-init list: ambiguous or not?,"<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>struct A {
    A(int, int) { }
};

struct B {
    B(A ) { }                   // (1)
    explicit B(int, int ) { }   // (2)
};

int main() {
    B paren({1, 2});   // (3)
    B brace{1, 2};     // (4)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The construction of <code>brace</code> in <code>(4)</code> clearly and unambiguously calls <code>(2)</code>. On clang, the construction of <code>paren</code> in <code>(3)</code> unambiguously calls <code>(1)</code> where as on gcc 5.2, it fails to compile with:</p>

<pre><code>main.cpp: In function 'int main()':
main.cpp:11:19: error: call of overloaded 'B(&lt;brace-enclosed initializer list&gt;)' is ambiguous
     B paren({1, 2});
                   ^
main.cpp:6:5: note: candidate: B::B(A)
     B(A ) { }  
     ^
main.cpp:5:8: note: candidate: constexpr B::B(const B&amp;)
 struct B {
        ^
main.cpp:5:8: note: candidate: constexpr B::B(B&amp;&amp;)
</code></pre>

<p>Which compiler is right? I suspect clang is correct here, as the ambiguity in gcc can only arise through a path that involves implicitly constructing <code>B{1,2}</code> and passing that to the copy/move constructor - yet that constructor is marked <code>explicit</code>, so such implicit construction should not be allowed. </p>
