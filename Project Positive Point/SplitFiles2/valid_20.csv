34776282,Type mysteries. Why does this code compile?,"<p>This code does not compile:</p>

<pre><code>default ()

f :: RealFloat a =&gt; a
f = 1.0

g :: RealFloat a =&gt; a
g = 1.0

h :: Bool
h = f &lt; g --Error. Ambiguous.
</code></pre>

<p>This is expected because it's ambiguous. The two possibilities are <code>Float</code> and <code>Double</code> and the compiler doesn't know which <code>&lt;</code> to pick.</p>

<p>However, this code <em>does</em> compile:</p>

<pre><code>default ()

f :: RealFloat a =&gt; a
f = 1.0

g :: RealFloat a =&gt; a
g = 1.0

h :: RealFloat a =&gt; a
h = f + g --Why does this compile?

<p>Why? Why isn't Haskell confused here, in a similar manner as in the example above, about which <code>+</code> to pick (for <code>Float</code> or <code>Double</code>)?</p>

                       , mode :: STRef s GPUMode -- GPU mode

<p>Is there any cleaner way for me to organize everything? I'd like to split up the state between the various components (CPU, GPU, cartridge bank switching, etc), if possible. Is it idiomatic to have a big monolithic state type in Haskell?</p>

<p>It's a pretty big pain to add new state to the program. The Control.Lens package seems to be up the right alley, but I'm not sure if I can combine it with ST very easily.</p>
