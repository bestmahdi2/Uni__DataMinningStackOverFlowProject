34706114,Get specific words followed by and preceed by words,"Hello There I need to get some words based on some other words that come after and before that words!
suppose that I have a String:
   
    not me and you but me and no you but me not

so that the output should be:
   
    not me
    and no
    no you
    me not

In simple words i want to get words with no and not comes after or before the specific words!
I am trying as:

    String regex = ""(?i)%s\\s+([\\S]+)\\s+([\\S]+)"";
    Matcher m = Pattern.compile(String.format(regex, Pattern.quote(""no""))).matcher(""not me and you but me and no you but me not"");
    
    while (m.find())
    {
        System.out.println(m.group(1));
    
    }
