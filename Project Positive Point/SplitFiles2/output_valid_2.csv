34559402,c# - List all primes upto 100,"Written the below code trying to identify all primes up 100. It's outputting 1,2 and 5. Can anyone see any reason why it wouldn't continue past the first 3?

I know there's some efficiency tweaks I can do (only odds numbers etc) but just trying to get the core (overkill) concept down first. I'm a complete noob just trying to enhance my intuition with programming so I know it's probably not the most elegant solution but more interested in why it doesn't work.

Appreciate any help.. HAPPY NEW YEAR!

34562473,Most Pythonic way to kill a thread after some period of time,"<p>I would like to run a process in a thread (which is iterating over a large database table). While the thread is running, I just want the program to wait. If that thread takes longer then 30 seconds, I want to kill the thread and do something else. By killing the thread, I mean that I want it to cease activity and release resources gracefully.</p>

<p>I figured the best way to do this was through a <code>Thread()</code>'s <code>join(delay)</code> and <code>is_alive()</code> functions, and an <code>Event</code>. Using the <code>join(delay)</code> I can have my program wait 30 seconds for the thread to finish, and by using the <code>is_alive()</code> function I can determine if the thread has finished its work. If it hasn't finished its work, the event is set, and the thread knows to stop working at that point.</p>

<p>Is this approach valid, and is this the most pythonic way to go about my problem statement?</p>

<p>Here is some sample code:</p>

<pre><code>import threading

# The worker loops for about 1 minute adding numbers to a set
# unless the event is set, at which point it breaks the loop and terminates
