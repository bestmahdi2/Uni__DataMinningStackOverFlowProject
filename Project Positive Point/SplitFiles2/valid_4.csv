<p>I do actually know if they are creates or updates, but I can simplify my code by just making them all <code>index</code>, or ""upserts"" in the SQL sense. </p>

<p>Is there any disadvantage in using <code>index</code> (and letting ES figure it out) over using the more explicit <code>create</code> and <code>update</code>?</p>

34577818,Finding any element with specific first coordinate in set<pair> >,"<p>I'm trying to figure out the following problem. </p>

<p>Suppose I have the following container in C++:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This set (dictionary) is sorted with respect to the order <code>&lt;</code> on <code>std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;</code>, which is the lexicographic order. My task is to find <strong>any</strong> element in <code>my_container</code> that has the first coordinate equal to, say <code>x</code>, and return the iterator to it. Obviously, I don't want to use <code>find_if</code>, because I need to solve this in logarithmic time.</p>

34582991,Why do we need field if we have property?,"i dont know whether this question will end up as a dumb question, 
but, it disturbing me.
So im reading some articles that emphasize the need of property to encapsulate fields in a class, 
if the property can store data (as field does) why do we still need field?
for example i have this class, 

    public class Music
    {
        public Music() { }
        public float musicBPM { get; set; } 
        public void addBPM()
        {
            this.muscBPM +=10;
        }
    }

its still working like as i have a private field and change its value , right?
so, whats the critical need of field if you can use the property?",<c#><.net><oop><properties>,16/01/03 23:49,LQ_EDIT
