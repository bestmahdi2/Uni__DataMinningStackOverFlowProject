<p>I developed a c++ lib that will do the comparison. I also display the preview, but I want to get the feed and convert it to bytes so I will be able to use the lib.</p>

<p>how can i do that?</p>

34659962,What would happen if Create a object in non-static method of class in java?,"    

    class Data
    {
    int x=20; // instance variable

		Data d1=new Data();
		int x=10;
		System.out.println(x); //  local x

	}
	public static void main(String...args)
	{
		Data d=new Data();
		d.show(); // ""10 20""
	}
}

So my question when an object is created in show() namely 'd1' , it must have its own set of data members and must have allocated a new stack for its show() method , which in return should create a new object and thus the cycle should go on and stack-overflow occurs??
But this is working perfectly fine??",<java><instance><stack-overflow><heap-memory><local-variables>,16/01/07 16:13,LQ_EDIT
