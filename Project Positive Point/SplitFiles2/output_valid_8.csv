34607210,How do you add a Root element/Tag in XML using perl,"I have a XML data which does not have a root element/tag. Is there a way where you can add a Root tag? This is just an example.

***Example : Existing XML***

         <Module name=""ALU"">

         <bidirection name=""address_bus""/>

         <bidirection name=""address_bus""/>

           <bidirection name=""add""/>
           </Module>

**NOTE:** I'm using XML::Simple module because the perl script is written in such and its tedious to convert to any other XML module as of now. It'll be great if we can get an explanation for the answer!

<p>And I'm unable to catch any byebug breakpoints.</p>

<p>According to the documentation, the (byebug:ctrl) prompt means that the program has terminated normally (<a href=""https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/blob/master/GUIDE.md"">https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/blob/master/GUIDE.md</a>), but sidekiq is running jobs just fine.</p>

<p>Is there something incorrect in my configuration, or is sidekiq just not compatible with byebug's remote debugging? </p>

<p><strong>Procfile:</strong></p>

<pre><code>sidekiq: bundle exec sidekiq
rails: rails server
</code></pre>

<p><strong>config/initializers/byebug.rb:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if Rails.env.development?
  require 'byebug'

  def find_available_port
    server = TCPServer.new(nil, 0)
    server.addr[1]
  ensure
    server.close if server
  end

  port = find_available_port

  puts ""Starting remote debugger...""
  Byebug.start_server 'localhost', port
  puts ""Remote debugger on port #{port}""
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that when I don't use remote debugging, byebug functions fine with sidekiq (although in foreman I can't see the prompt as I type).</p>

<p>Also note that I've tried using <code>Byebug.wait_connection = true</code> before <code>Byebug.start_server</code>, but I have the same issue.</p>
",<ruby-on-rails><sidekiq><foreman><byebug>,16/01/05 17:05,HQ,"<ruby-on-rails><sidekiq><foreman><byebug>, How to use Byebug with Sidekiq and Foreman, <p>I have a rails application in which I use foreman to start my rails and sidekiq servers. Since foreman doesn't interact well with regular byebug (you can't see the prompt as you type), I have set up remote debugging for both my rails and sidekiq servers. This works perfectly for the rails server, but when I connect to the byebug server for the sidekiq server, I get the following:</p>
