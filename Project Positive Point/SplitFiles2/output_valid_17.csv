34746775,Scheduling a second notification if first is ignored in swift (or completing any action if notification is ignored),"<p>So I have an app currently on the app store that schedules 10 notifications in advance assuming you miss one you will still get a second chance or ten. Now before you think I will be bothering the person, the notification is very important to the functionality of the app and really is the main purpose. The app was built for iOS 7 so at that time there was no ""handleActionWithIdentifier"" which can, from my understanding, complete actions for the app even if it is closed depending on the users response to the notification. This update was very helpful for the app as it eliminates part of my problem of having to open the app to respond to the notification (the notifications ask the user a question and depending on the answer, completes something).</p>

<p>The problem that remains is detecting if the notification was missed, how would I make another notification appear, for example the next day, if the notification is dismissed or ignored. I have searched this on google and stack overflow and from my understanding all previous questions have been asking how to detect if the notification was missed one the app is opened which I do not need.</p>

<p>At this point, I can properly run code if the user responds to the notification by pressing one of the options on the notification by this :</p>
