I don't need any inheritance and no method - only store these fields, and later have a list of these objects. Is class the proper object for me?
Thanks!</p>

<p>i'm trying to condense a string that only contains numbers and store it in a int vector 
the idea is to take each couple of numbers int the string and combain them into one integer 
the problem i had is with numbers that start with zero , for example 1107 only gets stored as 117 and 1100 as 110 
the other problem i had is with even numbers ;
any sultions please
thank you </p>

I have a string of names and I want to print them. I'm using the explode function. It works, however, my commas are being printed with the names and I don't want that. How can I make them not print? Any other help is appricated. Also how can I make my code more efficient? 

    $input = 'Jrew Low, Bill Wilt, Law Naw, Ing Holp';

    list($fName, $lName, $fNameTwo, $lNameTwo, $fNameThree, $lNameThree, $fNameFour, $lNameFour) = explode(' ', $formInputNames);
	if ($formInputNames == empty($fName) && empty($lName) || empty($fNameTwo) && empty($lNameTwo)){
		echo ""No Valid Name"";
	} else {
    // while ($fName == empty($formInputNames)){
    // 	echo ""something is missing"";
    // }
   	echo ""First Name: $fName <br> Last Name: $lName <br>"";
	echo ""Email Address: $fName$email <br><br>"";
	echo ""First Name: $fNameTwo <br> Last Name: $lNameTwo <br>"";
	echo ""Email Address: $fNameTwo$email <br><br>"";
	echo ""First Name: $fNameThree <br> Last Name: $lNameThree <br>"";

34641001,Upcasting in java for non primitive types,"Let us consider we have two classes A and B. B is a sub class for A because B extends A. If We create an instance of A Class and assign that in to a A type will contains all the properties of A. Similarly when I create an Instance of B and assign it to B type will get all the properties of B along with properties of A because it is inheriting from A. According to above lines instance of A contains properties a few as compared to properties contains to instance B. That means Instance of B is Bigger than Instance of A.
              As Casting should be explicit when narrowing implicit when widening. According to my theory Instance of B is bigger we are trying to store it in A type we need conversion.
                      
                     A a1=new (A)B();
               The above conversion is taking place implicitly. But my question is how it is implicit, Instance of B is bigger we are trying to convert that to small type which is A. How this is possible??? 

Answer me with examples thank you in advance. ",<java><casting>,16/01/06 19:16,LQ_EDIT

34642595,Tensorflow Strides Argument,"<p>I am trying to understand the <strong>strides</strong> argument in tf.nn.avg_pool, tf.nn.max_pool, tf.nn.conv2d. </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn.html#max_pool"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a> repeatedly says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>strides: A list of ints that has length >= 4. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What do each of the 4+ integers represent?</li>
<li>Why must they have strides[0] = strides[3] = 1 for convnets?</li>
<li>In <a href=""https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/3%20-%20Neural%20Networks/convolutional_network.ipynb"" rel=""noreferrer"">this example</a> we see <code>tf.reshape(_X,shape=[-1, 28, 28, 1])</code>. Why -1?</li>
</ol>

<p>Sadly the examples in the docs for reshape using -1 don't translate too well to this scenario.</p>
