34661207,How to Increase build vnext build agent execution time?,"<p>I am running a large suite of tests on my build server and it takes longer than an hour to get through them all. It is currently failing after an hour stating this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The job running on agent xAgentNamex has exceeded the maximum
  execution time of 01:00:00.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it would be in the <code>User capabilities</code> settings for the build agent but I could not see anything there.</p>

<p>How can I increase this limit?</p>

I've tried looking it up but can someone please explain this in a non-programmer language? I really have tried looking things up to understand but i'm just a bit clueless.My questions are about this;</p>

<pre><code>import re
line = ""Cats are smarter than dogs""
matchObj = re.match(r'(.*) are (.*?)*',line,re.M|re.I)

if matchObj:
  print(""matchObj.group():"",matchObj.group())
  print(""matchObj.group():"",matchObj.group(1))
  print(""matchObj.group():"",matchObj.group(2))
</code></pre>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>what does the (.*) do, i'm guessing you're trying to match 'cats' but then why don't you just type cats? I understand that . means 'any character' but i don't understand what * does</p></li>
<li><p>What does the combination (.<em>?)</em>' do?</p></li>
<li><p>What does re.M|re.I do?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks so mutch! I'm starting to become a bit desperate. My mind just doesn't work in the right way to understand this kind of things i think.</p>

34675961,Generalize 3 enums into one type,"<p>I'm writing a Java program that does some calculations on files.
The program supports 3 types of files (documents, images, videos) with each type allowing only few formats:</p>

<pre><code>enum DocType {
    pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx
}

enum ImageType {
    bmp, jpg, png, gif, ico
}

enum VideoType {
    avi, mpg, mp4, wmv, mov, flv, swf, mkv
}
</code></pre>

<p>In some point in my program, I would like to hold the file extension regardless of the file type, this means that I'd like to be able to do any of the following assignments:</p>

<pre><code>FileType fileExt = DocType.doc
FileType fileExt = ImageType.jpg
FileType fileExt = VideoType.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>How can I accomplish that behavior in Java? I know enums cannot extend other enums so basically the elegant solution is not possible.</p>
