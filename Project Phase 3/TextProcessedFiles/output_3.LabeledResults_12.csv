49508697,"Aggregate for each day over time series, without using non-equijoin logic","Initial Question
Given the following dataset paired with a dates table:
MembershipId | ValidFromDate | ValidToDate
==========================================
0001         | 1997-01-01    | 2006-05-09
0002         | 1997-01-01    | 2017-05-12

How many Memberships were open on any given day or timeseries of days?
Initial Answer
Following this question being asked here, this answer provided the necessary functionality:
select d.[Date]
      ,count(m.MembershipID) as MembershipCount
from DIM.[Date] as d
    left join Memberships as m
        on(d.[Date] between m.ValidFromDateKey and m.ValidToDateKey)
where d.CalendarYear = 2016
group by d.[Date]
order by d.[Date];
though a commenter remarked that There are other approaches when the non-equijoin takes too long.
Followup
As such, what would the equijoin only logic look like to replicate the output of the query above?
Progress So Far
From the answers provided so far I have come up with the below, which outperforms on the hardware I am working with across 3.2 million Membership records:
declare @s date = '20160101';
declare @e date = getdate();
with s as
(
    select d.[Date] as d
        ,count(s.MembershipID) as s
    from dbo.Dates as d
        join dbo.Memberships as s
            on d.[Date] = s.ValidFromDateKey
    group by d.[Date]
)
,e as
(
    select d.[Date] as d
        ,count(e.MembershipID) as e
    from dbo.Dates as d
        join dbo.Memberships as e
            on d.[Date] = e.ValidToDateKey
    group by d.[Date]
),c as
(
    select isnull(s.d,e.d) as d
            ,sum(isnull(s.s,0) - isnull(e.e,0)) over (order by isnull(s.d,e.d)) as c
    from s
        full join e
            on s.d = e.d
)
select d.[Date]
    ,c.c
from dbo.Dates as d
    left join c
        on d.[Date] = c.d
where d.[Date] between @s and @e
order by d.[Date]
;
Following on from that, to split this aggregate into constituent groups per day I have the following, which is also performing well:
declare @s date = '20160101';
declare @e date = getdate();
with s as
(
    select d.[Date] as d

I decided to abandon the above and write a @query to count as I only need to determine if the data exists or not and this has prevented the issue which is making me think I should change all my code to use @query.
 @Query(&quot;select count(*) as count from FBT where main_product_id = :id and collection= :collection&quot;)
    int countByMainProductIdAndCollection(@Param(&quot;id&quot;) long id, @Param(&quot;collection&quot;) Date collection);
Although this similarly also occurs seemingly randomly on updates into the database of one SProduct when the product exists in the database already.
SProductRepo.saveAndFlush(s);
I say randomly as 11 applications running the same code exit at random intervals with the above messages. There are no exceptions generated by the code and 10000's of successful database updates occur with the same code that leads to the failure. The code stops when trying to update the database where it has worked previously.

What I would like to know is what are the general reasons this kind of messages get generated?
Why do they stop my application despite try catch statements around my insertion statements that are the last executed statements in my code?
Are there log debugging settings useful to determine the exact reason for why the messages are generated?
Is there a way to turn off or control this functionality?

I had the following query in my fbt repository
  FBT findByMainProductAndCollection(SProduct mainProduct,Date collection);
which caused the following messages to be output exception when the data exists in the database for the mainProduct and collection but returns null otherwise.

  &lt;message&gt;HHH000100: Fail-safe cleanup (collections) : 
I decided to abandon the above and write a @query to count as I only need to determine if the data exists or not and this has prevented the issue which is making me think I should change all my code to use @query.
 @Query(&quot;select count(*) as count from FBT where main_product_id = :id and collection= :collection&quot;)
    int countByMainProductIdAndCollection(@Param(&quot;id&quot;) long id, @Param(&quot;collection&quot;) Date collection);
Although this similarly also occurs seemingly randomly on updates into the database of one SProduct when the product exists in the database already.
SProductRepo.saveAndFlush(s);
I say randomly as 11 applications running the same code exit at random intervals with the above messages. There are no exceptions generated by the code and 10000's of successful database updates occur with the same code that leads to the failure. The code stops when trying to update the database where it has worked previously.

Additionally the SProduct findByAsin(String asin) query cause the same problem however the query in the database works perfectly and this used to work in spring boot.

What I would like to know is what are the general reasons this kind of messages get generated?
Why do they stop my application despite try catch statements around my insertion statements that are the last executed statements in my code?
Are there log debugging settings useful to determine the exact reason for why the messages are generated?
Is there a way to turn off or control this functionality?

For example:

And this works fine; querying through a linked server works fine.
Disabling the deprecated &quot;Remote Access&quot; feature
There is apparently a little known, seldom used, feature known as remote access. Microsoft has very little to say about what this feature is, except to say here:
This configuration option is an obscure SQL Server to SQL Server communication feature that is deprecated, and you probably shouldn't be using it.
ⓘ Important
This feature will be removed in the next version of Microsoft SQL Server. Do not use this feature in new development work, and modify applications that currently use this feature as soon as possible. Use sp_addlinkedserver instead.
The remote access option only applies to servers that are added by using sp_addserver, and is included for backward compatibility.
And from the SQL Server 2000 Books Online:
 Note Support for remote servers is provided for backward compatibility only. New applications that must execute stored procedures against remote instances of SQL Server should use linked servers instead.
We only ever added linked servers, and have never used this &quot;remote access&quot; feature, and have never added a server using sp_addserver.
We're all good. Right?
Except turning off remote access breaks everything
An auditor has mentioned that we should turn off the remote access feature:
it's a security checkbox on their clipboard
it's deprecated by Microsoft
it's hardly ever used
and we don't use it
Should be fine, right?
Microsoft documents how to turn off this hardly used feature:
Configure the remote access Server Configuration Option
EXEC sp_configure 'remote access', 0 ;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE ;  
GO
Except when we do: everything goes to hell:
Msg 7201, Level 17, State 4, Procedure GetCustomer, Line 1
Could not execute procedure on remote server 'Screwdriver' because SQL Server is not configured for remote access. Ask your system administrator to reconfigure SQL Server to allow remote access.
Worse than failure?

EXECUTE sp_dropserver @server='screwdriver', @dropLogins='droplogins'

To Sum Up
We're at the point now where:

The remote access configuration option, that you adjust using sp_configure, is also exposed through the user interface. The SSMS UI describes the feature incorrectly:
It incorrect phrasing is:
Allow remote connections to this server
It should be phrased:
Allow remote connections to from this server.
The Books Online also document the feature incorrectly:
Allow remote connections to this server
Controls the execution of stored procedures from remote servers running instances of SQL Server. Selecting this check box has the same effect as setting the sp_configure remote access option to 1. Clearing it prevents execution of stored procedures from a remote server.
It should be:
Allow remote connections to from this server
Controls the execution of stored procedures from to remote servers running instances of SQL Server. Selecting this check box has the same effect as setting the sp_configure remote access option to 1. Clearing it prevents execution of stored procedures from to a remote server.
It makes sense that the youngsters at Microsoft these days don't remember what a 20 year old deprecated feature that they've never touched does.
Documentation from BOL 2000
SQL Server 2000 was the last time this feature was documented. Reproduced here for posterity and debugging purposes:
Configuring Remote Servers
A remote server configuration allows a client connected to one instance of Microsoft® SQL Server™ to execute a stored procedure on another instance of SQL Server without establishing another connection. The server to which the client is connected accepts the client request and sends the request to the remote server on behalf of the client. The remote server processes the request and returns any results to the original server, which in turn passes those results to the client.
If you want to set up a server configuration in order to execute stored procedures on another server and do not have existing remote server configurations, use linked servers instead of remote servers. Both stored procedures and distributed queries are allowed against linked servers; however, only stored procedures are allowed against remote servers.
 Note  Support for remote servers is provided for backward compatibility only. New applications that must execute stored procedures against remote instances of SQL Server should use linked servers instead.

48327065,Why does conversion from DATETIME to DATETIME2 appear to change value?,"I had a stored procedure comparing two dates. From the logic of my application, I expected them to be equal. However, the comparison failed. The reason for this was the fact that one of the values was stored as a DATETIME and had to be CONVERT-ed to a DATETIME2 before being compared to the other DATETIME2. Apparently, this changed its value. I have run this little test:
DECLARE @DateTime DATETIME='2018-01-18 16:12:25.113'
DECLARE @DateTime2 DATETIME2='2018-01-18 16:12:25.1130000'
SELECT @DateTime, @DateTime2, DATEDIFF(NANOSECOND, @DateTime, @DateTime2)
Which gave me the following result:
Why is there the difference of 333333ns between these values? I thought that a DATETIME2, as a more precise type, should be able to accurately represent all the values which can be stored in a DATETIME? The documentation of DATETIME2 only says:
  When the conversion is from datetime, the date and time are copied. The fractional precision is extended to 7 digits.
No warnings about the conversion adding or subtracting 333333ns to or from the value! So why does this happen?
I am using SQL Server 2016. 
edit: Strangely, on a different server I am getting a zero difference. Both are SQL Server 2016 but the one where I have the problem has compatibility level set to 130, the one where I don't has it set to 120. Switching between them changes this behaviour.
edit2: DavidG suggested in the comments that the value I am using can be represented as a DATETIME2 but not a DATETIME. So I have modified my test to make sure that the value I am assigning to @DateTime2 is a valid DATETIME value:
DECLARE @DateTime DATETIME='2018-01-18 16:12:25.113'
DECLARE @DateTime2 DATETIME2=CONVERT(DATETIME2, @DateTime)
SELECT @DateTime, @DateTime2, DATEDIFF(NANOSECOND, @DateTime, @DateTime2)
This helps a little because the difference is smaller but still not zero:

@Query(""SELECT DISTINCT c FROM Course c\n"" +

       ""AND (?1 IS NULL OR (c.id NOT IN (3, 4, 5)))\n"" +

       ""AND ((?3) IS NULL OR (c.category IN ?3)) "")
List&lt;Course&gt; getCoursesFiltered(Long courseId, String filter, List&lt;Category&gt; categories);
Error is :

And in the stack trace I can see :

Indeed generated query would be ... AND ((?3, ?4, ?5) IS NULL OR (c.category IN (?3, ?4, ?5))) if my list contains 3 elements. But IS NULL cannot be applied to multiple elements (query works fine if my list contain only one element).

55502546,Find mean of pyspark array<double>,"
In pyspark, I have a variable length array of doubles for which I would like to find the mean. However, the average function requires a single numeric type. 
Is there a way to find the average of an array without exploding the array out? I have several different arrays and I'd like to be able to do something like the following:
df.select(col(""Segment.Points.trajectory_points.longitude""))
DataFrame[longitude: array]
df.select(avg(col(""Segment.Points.trajectory_points.longitude""))).show()
org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve
'avg(Segment.Points.trajectory_points.longitude)' due to data type
mismatch: function average requires numeric types, not
ArrayType(DoubleType,true);;
If I have 3 unique records with the following arrays, I'd like the mean of these values as the output. This would be 3 mean longitude values.  
Input:  
[Row(longitude=[-80.9, -82.9]),
 Row(longitude=[-82.92, -82.93, -82.94, -82.96, -82.92, -82.92]),
 Row(longitude=[-82.93, -82.93])]
Output:  
-81.9,
-82.931,
-82.93
I am using spark version 2.1.3.
Explode Solution:
So I've got this working by exploding, but I was hoping to avoid this step. Here's what I did
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
longitude_exp = df.select(
    col(""ID""), 
    F.posexplode(""Segment.Points.trajectory_points.longitude"").alias(""pos"", ""longitude"")
)
longitude_reduced = long_exp.groupBy(""ID"").agg(avg(""longitude""))
This successfully took the mean. However, since I'll be doing this for several columns, I'll have to explode the same DF several different times. I'll keep working through it to find a cleaner way to do this.

48651369,What is the best practice of firestore data structure?,"I'm making a blog app using firebase.
I want to know the best practice of data structure.
As far as I know, there are 2 case.
(I'm using react native)
case 1:
posts
  -postID
   -title,content,author(userID),createdDate,favoriteCount
favorites
  -userID
    -favoriteList
      -postID(onlyID)
      -postID(onlyID)
In this case, for example, when we need to get favorite posts.
firebase.firestore().collection(`favorites/${userID}/favoriteList`)
    .get()
    .then((snapshot) =&gt; {
      snapshot.forEach((favorite) =&gt; {
        firebase.firestore().collection(`favorites/`).doc(`${favorite.id}`)
          .get()
          .then((post) =&gt; {
          myPostList.push(post.data())
        });
  });
in this case, we can't order the favorite posts by createdDate. So, need to sort client side. Even if so, we don't use limit() function.
case 2:
posts
  -postID
  -title,content,author(userID),createdDate,favoriteCount

        myPostList.push(post.data())
      });
  });
in this case, When the favorite post is modified by the author,
we have to update all of the favorite posts. (e.g. If 100 users save the post as a favorite, we have to update to 100 data.)
(And I'm not sure we can increment favoritecount by a transaction, exactly same.)
I think if we use firebase.batch(), we can manage it. But I think it seems Inefficient.
It seems that both ways are not perfect. Do you know the best practice of this case?

I want to know the best practice of data structure.
As far as I know, there are 2 case.
(I'm using react native)
case 1:
posts
  -postID
   -title,content,author(userID),createdDate,favoriteCount
favorites
  -userID
    -favoriteList
      -postID(onlyID)
      -postID(onlyID)
In this case, for example, when we need to get favorite posts.
firebase.firestore().collection(`favorites/${userID}/favoriteList`)
    .get()
    .then((snapshot) =&gt; {
      snapshot.forEach((favorite) =&gt; {
        firebase.firestore().collection(`favorites/`).doc(`${favorite.id}`)
          .get()
          .then((post) =&gt; {
          myPostList.push(post.data())
        });
  });
in this case, we can't order the favorite posts by createdDate. So, need to sort client side. Even if so, we don't use limit() function.
case 2:
posts
  -postID
  -title,content,author(userID),createdDate,favoriteCount
favorites
  -userID
     -favoriteList
       -postID
         -title,content,author(userID),createdDate,favoriteCount
       -postID
         -title,content,author(userID),createdDate,favoriteCount
firebase.firestore().collection(`favorites/${userID}/favoriteList`).orderBy('createdDate','desc').limit(30)
    .get()
    .then((snapshot) =&gt; {
      snapshot.forEach((post) =&gt; {
        myPostList.push(post.data())
      });
  });
in this case, When the favorite post is modified by the author,
we have to update all of the favorite posts. (e.g. If 100 users save the post as a favorite, we have to update to 100 data.)
