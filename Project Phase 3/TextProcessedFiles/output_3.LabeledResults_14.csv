48847660,Spark + Parquet + Snappy: Overall compression ratio loses after spark shuffles data,"Commmunity!
Please help me understand how to get better compression ratio with Spark?
Let me describe case:
I have dataset, let's call it product on HDFS which was imported using Sqoop ImportTool as-parquet-file using codec snappy. As result of import, I have 100 files with total 46 GB du, files with diffrrent size (min 11MB, max 1.5GB, avg ~ 500MB). Total count of records a little bit more than 8 billions with 84 columns
I'm doing simple read/repartition/write with Spark using snappy as well and as result I'm getting:
~100 GB output size with the same files count, same codec, same count and same columns.
Code snippet:
val productDF = spark.read.parquet(""/ingest/product/20180202/22-43/"")
productDF
.repartition(100)
.write.mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Overwrite)
.option(""compression"", ""snappy"")
.parquet(""/processed/product/20180215/04-37/read_repartition_write/general"")
Using parquet-tools I have looked into random files from both ingest and processed and they looks as below:
ingest:

In other hand, without repartition or using coalesce - size remains close to ingest data size.
Going forward, I did following:
read dataset and write it back with   
productDF
  .write.mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Overwrite)
  .option(""compression"", ""none"")
  .parquet(""/processed/product/20180215/04-37/read_repartition_write/nonewithoutshuffle"")

  .parquet(""/processed/product/20180215/04-37/read_repartition_write/nonewithshuffle"")
As result: 80 GB without and  283 GB with repartition with same # of output files

It seems, that parquet itself (with encoding?) much reduce size of data even without uncompressed data. How ? :)
I tried to read  uncompressed 80GB, repartition and write back - I've got my 283 GB
The first question for me is why I'm getting bigger size after spark repartitioning/shuffle?
The second is how to efficiently shuffle data in spark to benefit parquet encoding/compression if there any?
In general, I don't want that my data size growing after spark processing, even if I didn't change anything.
Also, I failed to find, is there any configurable compression rate for snappy, e.g. -1 ... -9? As I know, gzip has this, but what is the way to control this rate in Spark/Parquet writer?
Appreciate for any help!
Thanks!

54351783,duplicate key value violates unique constraint - postgres error when trying to create sql table from dask dataframe,"Following on from this question, when I try to create a postgresql table from a dask.dataframe with more than one partition I get the following error:

DETAIL:  Key (typname, typnamespace)=(test1, 2200) already exists.

You can recreate the error with the following code:

The code doesn't produce an error if npartitions is set to 1. So I'm guessing it has to do with postgres not being able to handle parallel requests to write to a same sql table...? How can I fix this?

It looks fine, but we have the following hierarchy Company &gt; Class &gt; Group &gt; Subgroup in the cube and if a user tries to use this hierarchy in filters - Grand Total fails (if any attribute is unchecked in this hierarchy). Sample:

Have you an idea why it happens and how to fix it?
Sales Amount is physical measure (not calculated measure), it is selected from SQL view (the same happens with every fact). 
I've asked the same question here, but nobody could answer it.
I've tried to delete all MDX calculations (scopes), but still Grand Total was incorrect. 
EDIT
I've noticed that the problem occurs when filtering like that:
1 element selected from the first level of the hierarchy, 1 element from 2nd level and 1 element from the 3rd level of hierarchy as in the image above.
If the 3rd level isn't filtered it shows good Grand Total.

49971903,Converting epoch to datetime in PySpark data frame using udf,"I have a PySpark dataframe with this schema:

If I simply return x + 1 in the function, it works. Trying float(x) or float(str(x)) or numpy.float(x) in time.localtime(x) does not help and I still get an error.

Are there any solutions?,"I've been trying to develop a simple AspNetCore application with EntityFrameworkCore to connect and work with the MSSQL server database. And manage all this by Rider IDE, a tool for Database client (DBeaver) and dotnet command line interface(dotnet ef). I'm using the database first approach(create a database on the MSSQL server, fill it with tables, and then build Models based on tables).
My STEP-by-STEP actions:
1)install and set up MSSQL server for my machine working on Ubuntu 18.04. Install the command line tool &quot;SQLCMD&quot;. ///

2)locally connected to my MSSQLServer instance.
sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'MyPasswd'
3)Using Transact-SQL created a Database and installed a DB client (DBeaver) to quickly manage my databases now and in the future.

Are there any solutions?, I've been trying to develop a simple AspNetCore application with EntityFrameworkCore to connect and work with the MSSQL server database. And manage all this by Rider IDE, a tool for Database client (DBeaver) and dotnet command line interface(dotnet ef). I'm using the database first approach(create a database on the MSSQL server, fill it with tables, and then build Models based on tables).
My STEP-by-STEP actions:
1)install and set up MSSQL server for my machine working on Ubuntu 18.04. Install the command line tool &quot;SQLCMD&quot;. ///
Link to guide - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu?view=sql-server-ver15
2)locally connected to my MSSQLServer instance.
sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'MyPasswd'
3)Using Transact-SQL created a Database and installed a DB client (DBeaver) to quickly manage my databases now and in the future.
The next step, as I supposed, was to use tutorials about connecting my Web Application to a database that was found here https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2017/08/09/running-entity-framework-core-commands-rider/ and here https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/efcore/create-model-for-existing-database-in-ef-core.aspx
My ASP.NET Core project's package references:
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
After typing in the CLI command
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold &quot;Server=localhost;Database=WebAppDB;Integrated Security=true;&quot; Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -c RsvpContext (
to build &quot;RsvpContext&quot; context to connect to my database WebAppDB.)
I see what I see:
Build started...
Build succeeded.

I see in the logs that the read is being executed properly with the given number of partitions as below:
Scan JDBCRelation((select column_names from schema.tablename where period_year='2017' and period_num='12') as year2017) [numPartitions=50]
Below is the state of executors in stages:
The data is not being partitioned properly. One partition is smaller while the other one becomes huge. There is a skew problem here.
While inserting the data into Hive table the job fails at the line:spark.sql(s""INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE schema.hivetable PARTITION(${prtn_String_columns}) select * from preparedDF"") but I understand this is happening because of the data skew problem.
I tried to increase number of executors, increasing the executor memory, driver memory, tried to just save as csv file instead of saving the dataframe into a Hive table but nothing affects the execution from giving the exception:
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
Is there anything in the code that I need to correct ? Could anyone let me know how can I fix this problem ?

I see in the logs that the read is being executed properly with the given number of partitions as below:
Scan JDBCRelation((select column_names from schema.tablename where period_year='2017' and period_num='12') as year2017) [numPartitions=50]
Below is the state of executors in stages:
The data is not being partitioned properly. One partition is smaller while the other one becomes huge. There is a skew problem here.
While inserting the data into Hive table the job fails at the line:spark.sql(s""INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE schema.hivetable PARTITION(${prtn_String_columns}) select * from preparedDF"") but I understand this is happening because of the data skew problem.
I tried to increase number of executors, increasing the executor memory, driver memory, tried to just save as csv file instead of saving the dataframe into a Hive table but nothing affects the execution from giving the exception:
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
Is there anything in the code that I need to correct ? Could anyone let me know how can I fix this problem ?

55248938,TypeORM and Postgres competing naming styles,"We are using TypeORM and Postgresql and I'm curious about naming conventions.
Given that there are perfectly appropriate styles and naming conventions for databases that are separate from the perfectly good ones used for Javascript, is it considered better practice to force databases to use the code convention or to force code to use the database convention, or to translate everything?
For example:
It's common practice to use the SQl style defined in Joe Celko's SQL Programming Style for the database. This advocates for snake_case for the column names.
It's also common practice to name variables in camelCase when programming in JavaScript and all the documentation on typeorm.
So, when these two worlds collide, is it best practice to force one to the other or to translate every multi-word entity in the definitions to do the mapping.
This isn't really a question of how to do that but rather if there is a common practice one way of the other.
The three possibilities for a column representing User Id are:
1: Translate everything
@Column( { name: user_id } )
userId: number;
2: Use the database convention in the code
@Column()
user_id: number;
3: Use the coding convention in the database
@Column()
userId: number
